Welcome To My Latest Blog
This is my third attempt at blog hosting. My first attempt was 
**_[Mr. Y's Lab Notes](http://mryslab.blogspot.com/)_**. 
There is a lot of good information on this blog from some of my earliest projects, 
but as you will plainly see, navigation leaves much to be desired, 
and there is some strange web page formatting.

My second attempt at blogging was 
**_[Bots In Pieces](https://mryslab.github.io/bots-in-pieces/)_**. 
Keeping the blog generator code 
up to date was a real challenge. This resulted in some of the 
navigation links leading to nowhere. Again, lots of good information to be found there.

And now, my third attempt.
I've been using 
**_[Mkdocs for Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)_** 
to document my most recent projects 
and found it highly stable and easy to use. Now that they support blog creation, 
I will give it a go. My hope is that it will encourage me to blog on a more regular 
basis than I have in the past.
Stay tuned!
