My first attempt was  Mr. Y's Lab Notes.  There is a lot of good information on this blog from some of my earliest projects,  but as you will plainly see, navigation leaves much to be desired,  and there is some strange web page formatting.</p> <p>My second attempt at blogging was  Bots In Pieces.  Keeping the blog generator code  up to date was a real challenge. This resulted in some of the  navigation links leading to nowhere. Again, lots of good information to be found there.</p> <p>And now, my third attempt. I've been using  Mkdocs for Material  to document my most recent projects  and found it highly stable and easy to use. Now that they support blog creation,  I will give it a go. My hope is that it will encourage me to blog on a more regular  basis than I have in the past. Stay tuned!</p>"},{"location":"archive/2023/","title":"2023","text":""},{"location":"category/welcome/","title":"Welcome","text":""}]}
